# Algorithm

Our program runs a constant update loop. All controller code can be found in `./Program/Controller/`, and is divided into three main modules: The `converter`, which pre-process images; `slam`, which is a modified SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm with limited landmark locations; and `controller`, divided into `slamcontroller`, `simplecontroller`, and `borkencontroller` (`borkencontroller` has not been tested and `slamcontroller` is currently also borked).

## Image Processing

All code for image processing is in `./Program/Controller/converter.py`.

### Undistorting

At the start of the program, cv2.fisheye.initUndistortRectifyMap is used with precalculated distortion matrices to create the remaps. See [ASSEMBLY.md](./ASSEMBLY.md#) for instructions on how to get the distortion matrix.

The undistort function calls `cv2.remap` to use the precalculated remaps to undistort the image. A new K matrix is used to partially zoom out the image to prevent too much of the image being cropped out.

### Filtering

Using `cv2.inRange`, a mask for red colors and green colors are created to filter out the traffic lights. For red pillars, two calls of `cv2.inRange` is necessary because the hue value has 180 to be red as well as 0. The two masks created for red are merged together with `cv2.bitwise_or`. The masks are then blurred to remove noise using `cv2.medianBlur`.

Using `cv2.cvtColor`, the image is turned into grayscale, and blurred using `cv2.GaussianBlur`. Then, using `cv2.Canny`, edges are detected in the image.

### Finding Wall Heights

The edges image is cropped to remove areas on the top and bottom of the image. The left camera is slightly tilted, so some areas of the left image get set to 0. `numpy.argmax` will find the index of the largest element in each subarray of the image. However, because the image only contains values of 0 and 255, `numpy.argmax` will return the first value that is 255. If no 255 values are found, `numpy.argmax` returns 0, which is a problem. To fix this, an array filled with a value of 255 is stacked to the end of the image using `numpy.hstack`.

### Finding Contours

Using `cv2.Canny`, edges can be found on the masked red or green image. To make sure `cv2.Canny` functions, a border is added using `cv2.copyMakeBorder`. The edges are blurred using `cv2.medianBlur`. Now, `cv2.findContours` can be used to find the contours on the image of edges. After finding the contours, using `cv2.contourArea` and `cv2.moments`, we can get the area and position of the contour. If the contour is smaller than `minContourSize`, or if the contour is above the walls, it gets thrown out.

### Finding Wall Lines

To find wall lines, we create a new image with only the bottom of the wall. For every obstacle, the nearby wall heights get set to 0 based on the size of the contour. Creating this image is optimized using `numpy.zeros`. The bottom of the wall is set to 255. We first create a list of indices so we can quickly set all the values to 255.

Using `cv2.HoughLinesP`, we can find lines on this newly created image. After sorting the lines based on x value, similar slope lines are merged.

### Merge Contours & Wall Lines

We can find the distance to any point on the top of the wall. Diagram 1 is a side view of the camera and the wall. Our cameras are positioned at the same height as the wall, so the top of the wall forms a straight line on the image. In diagram 1, the right line is the wall, which we know is 10cm tall. $d$ is the distance we want to calculate. $newf$ is the new focal length, which we will calculate later. $h$ is the height of the wall in pixels, which we get when we find the wall heights. The two triangles are similar, so $\frac{new f}{h} = \frac{d}{10cm}$. Isolating $d$ gives us $d = \frac{10cm \times newf}{h}$.

To calculate $new f$, we need to know the base focal length. For our undistorted image, we use an approximation of 80px as the base focal length. Diagram 2 is a birds eye view of the camera. $f$ is the base focal length, and $x$ is the x position of the wall relative to the center. Using the pythagorean theorem, we get $new f = \sqrt{f^2 + x^2}$.

Using this algorithm, which is in `getRawDistance`, we can convert the contours into x and y positions relative to the car. For wall lines, we convert each endpoint and connect them together.

## Simple Driver

All code for the simple driver is in `./Program/Controller/simplecontroller.py`.

### Finding Car Direction

For the first 9 frames, we search for a gap on the wall to find if we are going clockwise or counterclockwise. Using `numpy.diff`, we can find differences in the wall heights. After this, we split the two images from both cameras into 4 images. The left camera image gets split at 3/4 and the right camera gets split at 1/4. The left parts are used to detect a gap on the left, while the right parts are used to detect a gap on the right. Now, we use `numpy.argmax` to find the first large difference on all 4 images. We add the difference of the indices for the left and the indices for the right to `carDirectionGuess`. If `carDirectionGuess` is greater than 0, then we are going clockwise, otherwise we are going counter clockwise.

### Categorizing Walls

There are 4 possible categories of walls: Left, Center, Right, and Unknown. The slope of the wall relative to the car is calculated. If the slope is relatively small and the wall is in front of the car, the wall gets classified as a center wall. Otherwise, if the slope is small but it is behind the car, the wal gets classified as Unknown. If the wall is to the left of the car, it is a left wall, if it is to the right, it is a right wall.

### Filtering Traffic Signals

We find the largest pillar. If there are multiple pillars in the same spot we take the average of their positions.

### Calculating Steering

We calculate the average distance to the left walls, center walls, and right walls. Based on the relative angles of the walls to the car, we can calculate the angle of the car relative to the map. There are 3 cases for steering:

1. Center wall < 110cm
2. We are Uturning
3. Default case

In case 1, if there is no pillar detected, the car will keep straight and turn when the center wall is less than 70cm away. If there is a pillar detected, the car will turn when the pillar is close enough to pass in front or behind it.

In case 2, the car uses a precalculated set of instructions for making the 3 point turn. The gyro is used to determine how far we have turned.

In case 3, if there is no pillar detected, the car will keep straight. If there is a pillar, the car will calculate a tangent to the circle of radius 20cm centered on the pillar. The car calculates the left tangent for green pillars and right tangent for red pillars. Then, the car tries to keep itself pointed towards that tangent point.
