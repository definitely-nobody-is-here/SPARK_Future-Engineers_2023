# **Uploading & Using SPARK-Util tools**

TODO

*nodejs server is not needed*

# **Software Documentation**

## **Operating System**

We used Jetson Nano's operating system, which is Ubuntu 18.04. It has been changed to text-only mode to remove the unneccesary GUI. We also added a startup script ([see "Board Setup" in Assembly.md](./ASSEMBLY.md#board-setup-sshfs-and-static-ip)) to run the program on startup, which waits for a button press before running the program.

## **Programming Language**

All our code is in python (except the SPARK Control Panel and SPARK Randomizer, those are HTML/JS/CSS applications used for development). We use the following packages: ***add list***.

The **entire** `Program` directory must be uploaded in order for the program to run. Make sure the directory in `path` in `/Program/IO/io.py` is set correctly (you can use any existing directory with a `lock.txt`, but the uploaded folder is recommended)

Example:

```
path = '/home/nano/Documents/SPARK_FutureEngineers_2023/'
```

## **IO**

*detail IO processes (camera and IMU input, motor output)*

## **Input Processing**

All the code for image processing can be found in `/Program/AI/converter.py`.

## **SPARK Control**

***NEEDS UPDATING***

SPARK Control Panel is our own testing and debugging software.

<div align=center>

![SPARK Control Panel](./img/docs/SPARK_Control.png)

</div>

#### Setup

SPARK Control Panel requires some setup to use. See [Assembly.MD](./Assembly.md#setup-for-spark-control-panel) for more information.

It's possible to use SPARK Control to change the filter colors to adjust to the environment. Simply change the HSV sliders and use the "View Filtered Image" button to see the effects of your changes. Afterwards locate the color assignments in `/Program/AI/converter.py` and change them to match your environment.

Example:

```
rm = redMin = (0, 95, 75)
rM = redMax = (25, 255, 255)
gm = greenMin = (30, 30, 40)
gM = greenMax = (110, 255, 255)
bm = blueMin = (90, 80, 70)
bM = blueMax = (140, 255, 255)
```

You can update the defaults in `/SPARK-Control/index.js` as well in `initcolors`

Example:

```
const initcolors = [
    [
        [ 25, 255, 255 ],
        [ 0, 95, 75 ]
    ],
    [
        [ 110, 255, 255 ],
        [ 30, 30, 40 ]
    ],
];
```

**Don't forget to upload the `Program` folder again!**

# LiPo Battery Safety Notice

While LiPo batteries are the safest form of portable, affordable, high density energy storage, there are still precautions to be taken when working with them. Lithium is a highly volatile element, and will react with the water vapor in the air if exposed to it.

1. **Do not** puncture, deform, short, or heat LiPo batteries above 80° F
2. Store and charge LiPos in a *fireproof container* **away** from flammable materials and water
3. **NEVER** charge a swollen or damaged battery (e.g. damaged leads, swelling of cells, puncture in wrapping)
4. **NEVER** leave a charging battery unattended
5. Only charge LiPo batteries with chargers *designed for LiPo batteries*
6. Dropping a battery can cause sufficient damage to rupture a cell and cause shorts
7. Overdischarging a LiPo battery can cause **permanent damage**

If a LiPo battery goes below its minimum voltage (stated in the manual included or 3.3v multiplied by the amount of cells connected in series) it can cause **permanent internal damage**. This damage is not visible until after further use, when it can swell, or potentially burst and **cause a FIRE**.

**Read all safety notes and instructions included with LiPo batteries before use.**

### For a more detailed LiPo safety manual there is one on [Tenergy Power](https://power.tenergy.com/lipo-safety-warnings/)
